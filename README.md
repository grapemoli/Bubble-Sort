# Bubble-Sort
The famously simple Bubble Sort algorithm. 

Like a couple of my other projects, I originally kept this project on my GitHub Enterprise account. I moved the program to this account for ease of access.

## Goal
The goal of Bubble Sort is to implement the Bubble Sort Algorithm in C. While the Bubble Sort does not scale well with larger datasets (scales quadratically), the fundemental idea is still imperative. 

## Concepts
- C
- Pointers
- Algorithms
